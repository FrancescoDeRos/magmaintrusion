abstract = {Piton de La Fournaise (Réunion Island) had shown 8 months of high activity during 2003, including four eruptions and one intrusion. The monitoring networks, provided by the Volcanological Observatory of Piton de La Fournaise, show two different kinds of behavior: strong and rapid deformations linked with the magma injections and a slight continuous intereruptive inflation of the summit area. Inversed modeling based on the deformation data, using a three-dimensional elastostatic boundary element code, combined with seismicity provides new insights into the volcanic feeding system involved in the 2003 activity. (1) The 2003 eruptions are fed from a pressurized magma chamber located beneath the summit at 300 m above sea level. (2) A vertical path was activated between the magma chamber and the surface during the December 2002 collapse, allowing the magma to rise into it and leading to the initial summit eruption in May 2003. (3) The August and September 2003 lateral eruptions had been fed by dikes intruding along the same vertical pathway, at an estimated velocity of 1.1 to 1.3 m/s before intruding the flank into the rift zones at a velocity of 0.2 to 0.8 m/s. This last point suggests a strong structural control on the dike pathway.},

abstract = {Development of numerical methods for hydraulic fracture simulation has accelerated in the past two decades. Recent advances in hydraulic fracture modeling and simulation are driven by increased industry and research activity in oil and gas, a drive toward consideration of more complex behaviors associated with layered and naturally-fractured rock formations, and a deepening understanding of the underlying mathematical model and its intrinsic challenges. Here we review the basic approaches being employed. Some of these comprise enhancements of classical methods, while others are imported from other fields of mechanics but are completely new in their application to hydraulic fracturing. After a description of the intrinsic challenges associated with the mechanics of fluid-driven fractures, we discuss both continuum and meso-scales numerical methods as well as engineering models which typically make use of additional assumptions to reduce computational cost. We pay particular attention to the verification and validation of numerical models, which is increasingly enabled by an ever-expanding library of laboratory experiments and analytical solutions for simple geometries in a number of different propagation regimes. A number of challenges remain and are amplified with a drive toward fully-coupled, three-dimensional hydraulic fracture modeling that accounts for host-rock heterogeneity. In the context of such a drive to complex models, we argue that the importance of best-practice development that includes careful verification and validation is vital to ensure progress is constrained by the appropriate underlying physics and mathematics with a constant attention to identifying conditions under which simpler models suffice for the intended modeling purposes.}

abstract = {The theory describing the behavior of glacier crevasses that are partially filled with water is developed further, and the results are applied to the problem of vertical magma transport beneath oceanic ridges. It is assumed that lava collects beneath the center of a ridge. According to the theory, if a tensile stress acts across a ridge that is cold enough to behave like an elastic plate, a crack filled with liquid rock will nucleate at the bottom surface of the plate. This crack will increase in length and volume, pinch its lower end shut, and finally rise toward the top surface. (The immediate driving force causing the crack to rise is the Peach-Koehler force, which acts on dislocations. In the case of the liquid-filled crack the Peach-Koehler force produces a total, pseudo-Archimedian force that is identical in form to the true Archimedian buoyancy force on a solid within a liquid.) Eventually the crack will stop, and the lava in it will freeze and cause the oceanic ridge to spread somewhat. Lava will spill out onto the top surface only if an oversize crack reaches the upper surface. A crack that has been preceeded by other cracks on its upward journey will be trapped in the interior of the plate and its lava will freeze in place.},

The wholesale migration of fractures due to their opening at one end and closing at the other can be simulated when using a finite fluid mass contained in a fracture and considering fluid compression or expansion with changing fracture volume; these fractures are driven by stress gradients and by the density differences between the fluid and the surrounding rock. Contrary to commonly held beliefs, the fracture growth and the propagation directions are not controlled only by the direction of the principal stresses, but also by tectonic stress gradients, apparent buoyancy forces and the length of the fractures themselves.

abstract = {In this paper I present a model to estimate the shape and velocity of slowly ascending buoyancy-driven fluid-filled fractures. The model considers elastic deformation, linear fracture mechanics and fluid flow. An attempt is made to incorporate the effect ofthe 2-D fluid pattern on the viscous pressure drop. Most other models assume that the viscous pressure drop can be approximated by flow through a channel with constant width, although the form of the fracture is known to deviate from such a simple shape. The 2-D flow in my model has an important consequence for the mechanism of buoyancy-driven fracture propagation—it predicts a large pressure gradient at the tail of the propagating fracture, indicating that the tail of the fracture is most important in hindering the fracture propagation. A singularity at the tail of the fracture can be avoided when a small amount of fluid trails in the channel left behind the propagating fracture. The trailing and decoupling of fluids at the tail seems to be accompanied by small flow and shape instabilities, which is indicated by the jerky movement of the tail observed in propagating air-filled fractures in solidified gelatine, and by numerical boundary element solutions of the coupled flow-deformation–fracturing problem. By comparing the predictions for propagation velocities with laboratory observations of buoyancy-driven fracture propagation in gelatine, I derive a non-dimensional effective thickness at the tail of the fracture for which trailing of fluids may occur. The model is applied to Earth-relevant problems such as oil- and water-filled fractures in pressurized sediments or magma-filled dykes in the lithosphere, which are discussed in the paper.},

abstract = {We develop a mathematical model describing dyke propagation in proximity of an elastic discontinuity of the embedding medium. The dyke is modelled as a fluid-filled crack in plane strain configuration employing the boundary element method. The pressure gradient along the crack is assumed proportional to the difference between the densities of the host rock and the fluid. Mass conservation is imposed during propagation and fluid compressibility is taken into account. The path followed by the crack is found by maximizing the total energy release, given by the sum of the elastic and gravitational contributions. The mathematical simulations provide a sort of ‘refraction phenomenon’, that is a sudden change in the direction of propagation when the crack crosses the boundary separating different rigidities: if the dyke enters a softer medium, its path deviates towards the vertical, if the dyke enters a harder medium its path deviates away from the vertical and may even become arrested as a horizontal sill along the interface, if the rigidity contrast is large. Gravitational energy plays a major role during propagation; in particular, in proximity of layer boundaries, this role is enhanced by the shift of the centre of mass due to changes of dyke shape. Mathematical results were validated by laboratory experiments performed injecting tilted air-filled cracks through gelatin layers with different rigidities.},

abstract = {Dikes and sills are the moving building blocks of the plumbing system of volcanoes and play a fundamental role in the accretionary processes of the crust. They nucleate, propagate, halt, resume propagation, and sometimes change trajectory with drastic implications for the outcome of eruptions (Sigmundsson et al., 2010). Their dynamics is still poorly understood, in particular when different external influencing factors are interacting. Here we apply a boundary element model to study dike and sill formation, propagation and arrest in different scenarios. We model dikes as finite batches of compressible fluid magma, propagating quasi-statically in an elastic medium, and calculate their trajectories by maximising the energy release of the magma-rock system. We consider dike propagation in presence of density layering, of density plus rigidity layering, of a weakly welded interface between layers, under the action of an external stress field (of tectonic or topographic origin). Our simulations predict sill formation in several situations: i) when a horizontal weak interface is met by a propagating dike; ii) when a sufficiently high compressive tectonic environment is experienced by the ascending dike and iii) in case a dike, starting below a volcanic edifice, propagates away from the topographic load with a low dip angle. We find that dikes halt and stack when they become negatively buoyant and when they propagate with low overpressure at their upper tip toward a topographic load. Neutral buoyancy by itself cannot induce dikes to turn into sills, as previously suggested.}

abstract = {Abstract Dykes are magma-filled fractures propagating through the brittle crust. Understanding the physics of dyking process is essential to mitigate the volcanic hazard associated with the opening of new eruptive fissures at the surface. Often, physics-based models view either fracturing of the host rock or viscous flow of the magma as the dominating energy sink during dyke propagation. Here, we provide a numerical model that captures the coupling of fracturing at the crack tip and the transport of a viscous fluid. Built with the boundary element technique, our model allows for computation of the shape and velocity of a growing fluid-filled crack accounting for the viscosity of the fluid: the fluid flow induces a viscous pressure drop acting at the crack walls, and modifies the shape of the crack. The energy conservation equation provides the constraints to solve for the crack growth velocity, assuming that brittle fracturing and viscous flow are the main processes that dissipate energy. Using a parameter range that represents typical magmatic intrusions, we obtain crack shapes displaying some typical characteristics, including a tear-drop head and an open tail that depend on rock rigidity, magma viscosity, and buoyancy. We show that viscous forces significantly contribute to the energy dissipated during the propagation of magmatic dykes. Applied to the 1998 intrusion at Piton de la Fournaise (La Réunion Island), we provide ranges of dyke lengths and openings by adjusting the numerical velocity to the one deduced from the migration of volcano-tectonic events.},

abstract = {Magma-driven fractures must be an important mechanism for the transport of magma through the crust and lithosphere. Dikes are pervasive throughout the crust and clearly play an important role in active volcanoes. A magma fracture is the only mechanism that allows sufficiently high magma velocities to prevent complete solidification during transport through cold country rock. The analysis of magma-driven fractures is complex because it involves flow in the fracture (often turbulent), the elastic deformation of the country rock surrounding the fracture, and the propagation of the fracture. For vertically propagating magma fractures, buoyancy forces may be the dominant driving mechanism. In order to simplify the analysis of this problem we neglect the elastic distortion of the country rock and the fracturing process. We consider a buoyant fluid initially in an elliptical two-dimensional cavity. The shape of the upwardly deforming cavity is shown to satisfy the nonlinear kinematic wave equation. For laminar flow the cavity initially deforms but does not move upward. At a critical time the solution near the top of the crack becomes multivalued indicating the presence of an upwardly propagating shock wave. The tail of the upwardly propagating crack closes but does not move upwards. Solutions have also been obtained for turbulent flow. Velocities of upward propagation for appropriate parameter values indicate this mechanism can explain the observed characteristics of kimberlite eruptions. Inclusion of elastic and fracture properties will determine the structure of the shock wave, that is, the crack tip, but would not effect the applicability of our solution.},

abstract = {Magma transport in brittle rock occurs by diking. Understanding the dynamics of diking and its observable consequences is essential to deciphering magma propagation in volcanic areas. Furthermore, diking plays a key role in tectonic phenomena such as continental rifting and plate divergence at mid-ocean ridges. Physics-based models of propagating dikes usually involve coupled transport of a viscous fluid with rock deformation and fracture. But the behavior of dikes is also affected by the exchange of heat with the surroundings and by the interaction with rock layering, pre-existing cracks, and the external stress field, among other factors. This complexity explains why existing models of propagating dikes are still relatively rudimentary: they are mainly 2D, and generally include only a subset of the factors described above. Here, we review numerical models on dike propagation focusing on the most recent studies (from the last 15 to 20years). We track the influence of two main philosophies, one in which fluid dynamics is taken to control the behavior and the other which focuses on rock fracturing. It appears that uncertainties in the way that rock properties such as fracture toughness vary from laboratory to field scale remain one of the critical issues to be resolved. Finally, we present promising directions of research that include emerging approaches to numerical modeling and insights from hydraulic fracturing as an industrial analog.}

abstract = {Abstract We present analog experiments on dike propagation, followed by a numerical model of horizontal and vertical growth, which is partially analytical and partially based on empirical observations. Experimental results show that the growth rates are similar until buoyancy becomes significant and, afterward, vertical growth dominates. The numerical model is defined for different conditions in a homogeneous medium: (a) constant flux, fracture-limited propagation; (b) constant flux, viscous-limited propagation; and (c) variable flux dependent on the driving pressure and dike dimensions. These conditions distinguish between cases when the influx depends on the deeper source of magma (e.g., a conduit, independent of the dike geometry) and when it depends on the dike, so the influx can change as it grows. In all cases, the ratio of vertical to horizontal propagation is proportional to the ratio of buoyancy pressure to source pressure, in which buoyancy drives vertical propagation. We test the numerical model on dikes observed at Piton de la Fournaise, in which the dimensions were estimated using geodetic and seismic data. The results show that the final dimensions can be reproduced using magma-crust density differences of 50–300 kg/m3, viscosities of 30–300 Pa·s, influxes of 50–750 m3/s and shear moduli of ∼10 GPa. The modeled magma and host rock parameters agree with previous studies of the volcano, while the flux is higher than what is typically observed during eruption. This implies a variable injection condition, in which the flux peaks during propagation and diminishes by the onset of eruption.},
